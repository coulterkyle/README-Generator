## Description

This project makes README markdown file generation quick and easy!The motivation for this project was to produce an app that could quickly and effortlessly make README markdownfiles for your next project! README generation can be one of the mopre boring and tedeious parts of any project but overlooking this important aspect can leave your projects looking unprofessional. This project solves that issue by taking in all of the necessary info for a professional README and packing into a neat and tidy final product. I was able to demonstrate principals of node.js and npm i learned in bootcamp coding class.
