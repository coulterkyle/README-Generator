## Description

This project makes README markdown file generation quick and easy!

The motivation for this project was to produce an app that could quickly and effortlessly make README markdown files for your next project. 

README generation can be one of the more boring and tedeious parts of any project but overlooking this important aspect can leave your projects looking unprofessional.

This app solves that issue by taking in all of the necessary info for a professional README and packing it into a neat and tidy final product.

I was able to demonstrate principals of node.js and npm I learned in bootcamp coding class.

## Installation

Run "node index.js" under the index.js file. Make sure all of the proper extensions are installed on your local machine and in this file!

## Useage

After you run the command prompt to start the app. You will be presented with a series of questions. The information you provide in your answers will be inserted into your README. Once completed, the app will confirm generation of your README file with "Success!" or give you the error code. Remember to install the proper extensions with running "npm install".
