## Description

This project allows for quick and easy README markdown generation.

README sections can be tedeious and laborious and becuase of this fact sometimes they lack critical components. This app makes README markdown generation quick and easy and, most importantly, makes sure all of the crutil information is included in a professional final product.

This app is important to developers who wish to provide professional README markdowns and dont want to spend time anymore time on the subject than is absolutely necessary.



This project allowed me to use node.js and npm principals I learned in coding class and expand on my general knowledge of the subjects.
