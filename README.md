## Description

This project was intended to streamline the process of creating a README markdown file.

README generation can be a pain. This app streamlines the process.

The purpose of this project was to make README markdown generation quick and easy. The result is a professional README.

The issue of README generation can be tedious and laborious and therefore can result in sub-par READMEs - this app eliminates that issue.

This project allowed me to demonstrate my knmowledge of node.js and npm learned in bootcamp.
